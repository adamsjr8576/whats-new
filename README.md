# What's New?

## Refactor

This project has been refactored to use React Hooks in place of class based components. Both the App and SearchForm componenets have been refactored to functional components using React Hooks.

## Abstract

This project served as an intro to learning the basics of React using Create React App. We created a news article site that pulls data from an API via fetch. The site displays the news article based on the topic and has functionality to switch between topics. The user is also able to search the current topic of articles by keywords in the title. This was our first project/app built using React.


## Set Up

### Clone Down & Run Locally:

1. Fork repo and clone down or just clone down
2. cd into directory and run ```npm install``` to install library dependencies
3. In terminal run ```npm start``` to create locally hosted served to run app
4. You will see a bunch of code - find `http://localhost:8080/` and copy into your web browser

## Goals

 - Learn to pass information between components using props.
 - Write squeaky clean, well refactored code using ES6 syntax.
 - Learn to write readable JSX (your render methods/return statements should be clean and simple).
 - Use propTypes for every component receiving props.
 - Learn how to unit test React components including snapshot testing, methods, and changes in state.
 - Implement fetch within React app.
